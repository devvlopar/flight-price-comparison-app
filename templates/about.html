                                    International travel makes up the majority of what we do. Flight booking is, of
                                    course, a big part of that.

                                </h3>
                                <p class="mb-3 font-weight-midd text-20 text-gray text-18">
                                    The greatest challenge with flight booking for us as travel agents is keeping within
                                    the budget created when the trip was priced for the client.
                                </p>
                                <p class="mb-3 font-weight-midd text-20 text-gray text-18">
                                    Flight prices fluctuate continuously because of the use of dynamic (demand-based)
                                    pricing systems which can cause us significant headaches
                                </p>
                                <h4 class="mb-3 text-black pt-2">
                                    For example:
                                </h4>
                                <p class="mb-3 font-weight-midd text-20 text-gray text-18">
                                    We might price flights for a client a week or two before they agree to proceed, pay
                                    their deposit and provide passport (name) details. When it comes time to book the
                                    flights, the prices might have increased by 20% or more. We know that lower prices
                                    might be possible because we found lower prices previously.
                                </p>
                                <p class="mb-3 font-weight-midd text-20 text-gray text-18">
                                    So, we wait until the prices come back into line with the budget. That happens 95%
                                    of the time. The 5% is usually premium seats (premium economy and business) which
                                    sell out more quickly that economy, and remaining seats are maintained at high
                                    minimum prices.
                                </p>
                                <p class="mb-3 font-weight-midd text-20 text-gray text-18">
                                    We know from experience that flights will start adjusting 55 to 115 days in advance.
                                    But it is time consuming checking those prices regularly.

                                    When you look at flight prices for a trip, especially international flights, you
                                    have no idea whether the price is reasonable or inflated. Unless you regularly book
                                    that same flight, you are at a complete disadvantage.
                                </p>
                                <p class="mb-3 font-weight-midd text-20 text-gray text-18">
                                    The result, much to the delight of airlines, is high profits because people pay too
                                    much for flights through a lack of information.
                                </p>

                                    Your challenge is the same as oursâ€¦ Knowing what a reasonable price is, and when to
                                    book.
                                </p>
                                <p class="mb-3 font-weight-midd text-20 text-gray text-18">
                                    Is the current price the lowest it will go? Or should I wait?
                                </p>
                                <p class="mb-3 font-weight-midd text-20 text-gray text-18">
                                    The FlightChkr.com system will help you make an informed decision about when to
                                    book. It uses a vast amount of historical flight price data along with AI to analyse
                                    current prices.

                                    If you do a search and the indicator says the lowest available price is a GOOD DEAL
                                    you know that now is the right time to book.

                                    However, if the indicator show that the price is too high, then you can decide on
                                    the best course of action. You might have no choice but to book now. But in most
                                    cases, you can wait, especially if you are booking at least three months out.

                                    Many people get nervous about waiting to book for fear of not getting seats. Unless
                                    you are booking in a peak travel period and/or the number of airlines offering fares
                                    is very limited, you will usually have options.
                                </p>
                                <p class="mb-3 font-weight-midd text-20 text-gray text-18">
                                    Go onto the websites for your preferred airlines and check the available seating for
                                    the most suitable flights. This can usually be done during the booking process
                                    before payment, so you can cancel out before going that far.
                                </p>
                                <p class="mb-3 font-weight-midd text-20 text-gray text-18">
                                    If there are plenty of seats and you have a few months to go before departure, you
                                    have no need for concern. A final decision should be made no later than 30 to 45
                                    days before departure. After this time, airlines move prices up to maximize profits
                                    from the less price-sensitive business market.
                                </p>
